BlockDiagnose
==========================================
For all the blocks in your mesh the BlockDiagnose script provides
an interface through which you can specify:

1. The mesh quality metrics to compute.
2. Upper and lower bounds for each metric.

The resulting text report is printed to Pointwise's messages window
and tallies the metrics you specified for all blocks and the entire grid.
